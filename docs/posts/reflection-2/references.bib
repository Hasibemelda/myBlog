	abstract = {Psychologists have made substantial progress at developing empirically validated formal expressions of how people perceive, learn, remember, think, and know. In this article, we present an academic search engine for cognitive psychology that leverages computational expressions of human cognition (vector-space models of semantics) to represent and find articles in the psychological record. The method shows how psychological theory can be used to inform and aid the design of psychologically intuitive computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {We used skilled typing as a task to investigate underlying cognitive processes involved in skilled action sequencing. In general, the major finding was that variation in typing performance at the letter level (how fast or you slow a typist types particular letters) can be well-explained by the statistics of letter occurrences as they appear in natural text. Our findings have implications for cognitive theory, and may also be useful for guiding typing curriculum for training typing skill.},

	title = {"Schema abstraction" in a multiple-trace memory model},
	abstract = {A simulation model of episodic memory, {MINERVA} 2, is applied to the learning of concepts, as represented bythe schema-abstraction task. The model assumes that each experience produces a separate memory trace and that knowledge of abstract oncepts i derived from the pool of episodic traces at the time of retrieval. A retrieval cue contacts all traces imultaneously, activating each according to its similarity to the cue, and the information retrieved from memory reflects the summed content of all activated traces responding in parallel. The {MINERVA} 2 model is able to retrieve an abstracted prototype of the category when cued with the category name and to retrieve and disambiguate a category name when cued with a category exemplar. The model successfully predicts basic findings from the schema-abstraction literature (.g., differential forgetting of proto-types and old instances, typicality, and category size effects), including some that have been cited as evidence against exemplar theories of concepts. The model is compared to other classification models, and its implications regarding the abstraction problem are discussed. How is abstract knowledge related to specific experience? In present-day terms, this question concerns the relationship be-tween episodic and generic memories. This article explores the},
