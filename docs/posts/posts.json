    "description": "The week's reading provide an account of various theories infomation and cognitive models of processing and abstraction. Across each conceptualization and theory, a few general themes arise: given the interoperabilty of words and semantics, how are objects and events categorized, indexed, and retrieved as knowledge? And how should all these meanings and relationships be quantified?",
