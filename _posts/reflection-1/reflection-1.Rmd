title: " ðŸ““ Assignment Week 1"
description: Reflecting upon the readings, I identified a few emergent themes central to cognitive psychology; 1) In order to survive our constantly fluctuating environment, we rely on a broad set of cognitive phenomena â€” attention, memory, perception and language, etc. â€” to process information and stimuli from the environment. 2) Future research insights within cognitive psychology and the broader scientific community need to acknowledge a complete view of our unique cognitive capacities and information processing systems.

## The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information [@miller_magical_1956]

George A. Miller | Harvard University

### Highlights & Notes
Miller provides key theoretical ideas fundamental to contemporary cognitive psychology and information processing theory \â€“ short and long term memory. Information processing theory \â€“ or __recoding__ as described by Miller \â€“ is a general theory of human cognition.

> "In the jargon of communication theory this process would be called __recoding__." \â€“ p.93

- A key concept to the idea is __chunking__ and the capacity of short term memory.

- Short-term memory holds 5 - 9 __chunks__ of information (Â± 2) wherein a __chunk__ is any meaningful __bits__ of information â€“ digits, words, chess moves, or peopleâ€™s faces.

  - Note: A single __bit__ is distinguished as the amount of information that we need to make a decision when considering a binary â€“ whereas a __chunk__ can be viewed as organizing or grouping the information into familiar units or __chunks__.

- Given a fixed number of __chunks__, we increase the amount of __bits__ of information that it contains by simply building larger and larger __chunks__.

#### The Magical Number Seven

<aside>
  5x __chunks__ (Â±2)

  #  ðŸŽ° 7
</aside>

There is nothing "magical" about the number seven. Miller used the expression rhetorically.

The number seven represents a useful heuristic, lists or __chunks__ that are much longer (Â±2) become significantly harder to remember and process simultaneously.

> "There seems to be some limitation built into us either by learning or by the design of our nervous systems, a limit that keeps our channel capacities in this general range." \â€“ p.86

- This magical number 7 only applies to one-dimensional judgments.


#### Recoding

Throughout our daily routines and behaviors, in one form or another we use recoding constantly.

> "By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence of __chunks__, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck." \â€” p.95

For instance, within human language there is a limit to the number of tones and sounds that we use in speech, yet speech uses sequences of phonemes, enabling us to __recode__ these successive sounds into richer information groups when we listen to words and sentences.

> "In particular, the kind of linguistic __recoding__ that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes." \â€” p.95

#### Discussion Questions

- Does the __chunking__ differ in children vs adults?

- How do we clarify long term memories or recollections in relation to __recoding__ vs __attention__?

- What role does this have when considering __learning and development__?

## You can't play 20 questions with nature and win: projective comments on the papers of this symposium [@newell_you_1973]

Allen Newell | Carnegie Mellon University

### Highlights & Notes

Allen Newellâ€˜s 1973 article â€” considered a classic within cognitive science â€” provides an account of his confession â€” despite there being many exemplary psychology experiments, each making scientific contributions on its own â€” he cannot see how any of it can serve as a cohesive set of progress when viewed as a whole.

> "Psychology, in its current style of operation, deals with phenomena." \â€” p.2

Newell describes the current state of psychology as too focused on individual _phenomena_ â€” __chunking__ in memory, subitizing, etc â€“ as studied in a way to resolve classic dichotomies â€“ binaries such as nature vs nature, conscious vs unconscious, serial vs parallel __processing__.

> "Psychology also attempts to conceptualize what it is doing, as a guide to investigating these phenomena." \â€” p.5

#### Diagnosis:

_Phenomena_ generates an endless excellent papers without endless progress is that people can do the same task in different ways.

> "Much of the new progress in the experimental analysis of the information processing of humans has eschewed attention to the control strurture." \â€” p.15

Without constraining a personâ€™s goals and the structure of the task environment â€” essential to predict behavior â€” no insights can be progressed. At a minimum, we must understand the method participants are using on the task â€” many experiments only dissect how people are doing the task.

#### Prognosis:

> "I will spend no time arguing that what is needed is to view man as an information processing system". \â€” p.18

As a prognosis for how to make real progress in understanding the mind he proposes three possible courses of action:


- Complete Processing Models

- Analyze a Complex Task

- One Program for Many Tasks


#### Discussion Questions

1. Does this require a generally intelligent (complete) processing model?

### Richard Semon's Theory of Memory [@schacter_richard_1978]

Schacter et al. | University of Toronto

### Highlights & Notes

A relatively unknown but nonetheless critical figure, Richard Semon theorized a system and theory of memory that anticipated numerous contemporary concepts and modern theories.

As a universal theory that broadened the conceptual understanding of memory to include more than the basic memorization of facts, events, and whatnot â€” Semon argued to consider heredity and reproduction as forms of __memory__ that preserve the effects of experience across multiple generations.

Semon called this core process â€” related to both heredity and everyday memory â€” __"Mneme"__.

- As according to Semon, __Mneme__ is a fundamental organic plasticity that allows the preservation of effects of experience.

It is based upon two fundamental ideas, which he coined and termed the __Law of Engraphy__ and the __Law of Ecphory__.

1) _Engraphy_ refers to the encoding of information into memory.

2) _Ecphory_  refers to a retrieval process

The theory attempted to unify and explain more phenomena and issues than nealy all other theories at the time.
